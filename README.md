# Discretizing-the-Dynamic-Response-of-Current-Carrying-MEMS-Devices
In the previous note we derived the first and
second order approximation of the system and
compared the model with the original lumped
elastic current carrying MEMS model.
In this note we proceed as follow:

i. Choose a proper sampling time Ts to
discretize the system

ii. Use Euler’s forward derivative
approximation and linearize the state
equations

iii. Finding the ZOH discrete equivalent of
the first note’s state-space equations

iv. Comparing the discrete and non-discrete
responses for different sampling rates

v. Presenting the linear system’s transfer
function

vi. Comparing the Bode’s diagrams of the
last two systems for different sampling
rates
